# Berry ORM

[中文](./README_zh.md)

Strictly typed, lightweight object-relational mapper for Node.js and browsers.

```sh
npm i berry-orm
```

Berry ORM allows you to define entity classes to transform between ordinary plain data objects and entities.

An entity is an instance of an entity class defined by yourself, which allows you to access and update the bilateral relations conveniently. You can also transform an entity back into an plain data object, whose shape can be flexibly customized.

What's more, Berry ORM has an extremely strong focus on types, and all the features have extremely strict type support to maximize the benefits of TypeScript.

# Scenarios

- When storing relational data in simple files like "data.json"
- Any time you need to manage relational data without using a database!
